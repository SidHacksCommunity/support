## TL;DR

Be respectful. Abuse & Harassment are not at all tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable or unsafe in our community by means of members, leaders, or any other person, please report it using the steps included in this document.

This code of conduct shall be applicable in all spaces where our community exists or gets involved which includes all the communication platforms, social media, talks, events, collaborations, etc.
